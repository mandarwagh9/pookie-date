## Firebase Configuration  
To connect the app to your Firebase Firestore:  

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).  
2. Create a new Firebase project or use an existing one.  
3. Add a web app to your project to get the Firebase configuration details.  
4. Replace the placeholder Firebase configuration in the `index.html` file:  
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
     measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
   };
   ```  
5. Enable Firestore Database in your Firebase project.  
6. Set Firestore rules to allow writes (for testing):  
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if true; // Replace this with stricter rules for production
       }
     }
   }
   ```  

---

## Code Structure  
- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure and inlined JavaScript.  
- **Styles**: CSS is written in a `<style>` block within the `index.html`.  
- **Firebase Integration**: JavaScript functions handle Firestore operations.
